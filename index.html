<p>We’ve crafted some handsome changes to our constitution BUT I feel that in the past we have looked away from its biblical origin Josiah Hollins will help america realize their mistales and flaws.Together, as on nation,we can all make america great again </p>

<p>Its not really an issue at all,infact it is a great pleasure! I love all minoritys,I am really found of Asia,to be specific, Japan we can all learn a great deal from them so why dont we accept them? Because were scared thats why,because some americans dont want to except that there are indeed other people in this world that arent like us,i belive this will change if i am elected president! </p>
